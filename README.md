# UAV

This project simulates a Drone Delivery Service and visualizes key metrics using Python and Excel. It features:

Features:
Flight Scheduling: Simulates drone flights between real-world locations in India.
Cost Calculation: Automated cost calculation based on distance, weight, and flight duration.
Data Visualization: Flight routes are visualized using Python's matplotlib and delivery metrics are plotted.
Excel Dashboard: A fully designed dashboard in Excel displaying delivery history, costs, and flight times.
Technologies Used:
Python for calculations and route plotting.
Matplotlib for visualizing flight routes.
Pandas for data handling.
Excel for the final dashboard.
Check out the dataset used for analysis (locations, distance, weight, and cost) and see how drones could transform logistics!
